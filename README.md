Problem Tree
============

A problem tree provides an overview of all the known causes and effect to an identified problem. This is important in planning a community engagement or behaviour change project as it establishes the context in which a project is to occur. Understanding the context helps reveal the complexity of life and this is essential in planning a successful change project.

A problem tree involves writing causes in a negative form (eg. lack of knowledge, not enough money etc). Reversing the problem tree, by replacing negative statements with positive ones, creates a solution tree. A solution tree identifies means-end relationships as opposed to cause-effects. This provides an overview of the range of projects or interventions that need to occur to solve the core problem.

A problem tree analysis:
* Helps the planning of a project
* Provides a guide as to the complexity of a problem by identifying the multiple causes
* Identifies particular lines of intervention and other factors that may need to be tackled with complementary projects
* Provides an outline of the project plan, inlcuding the activities that need to be undertaken, the goal and the outcomes of the project.

As the name implies, this resembles a tree. The roots of the tree, in the lower part of the drawing, metaphorically represent the causes of the main problem. The tree trunk at the centre of the drawing represents the main problem and the tree branches, on the upper side of the drawing, provide a visual representation of the effects of the main problem.

The whole purpose of the problem tree is to define the main problems present in the community in order to analyse and prioritise their causes as the first step towards effective sustainable solutions. Probably the most important tool to keep in mind throughout this process is a single question or rather a single word: 'WHY?' It is amazing how this short word can generate unexpected insights, which greatly help in developing an effective communication strategy. Never be afraid of asking or wondering why something is happening, even if it seems obvious.
